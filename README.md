# Chat-Bot---feed-data-from-Web-Scrapping-implement-Tensor-Flow
The purpose of this project is to create a ChatBot that can read data from multiple websites and based upon those pieces of information it can return answers to the user questions.  Summary:  Task 1: As a part of this project, first we will try to scrape data from multiple URL's and then we will create DataFrame to store that information in the form of Questions and Answers.  Task 2. Once DataFrame is created successfully then we will use pandas to read data from DataFrame. After that, we will use machine learning so that when the user asks any question then it will fetch a relevant answer from the DataFrame and return it to the user.
